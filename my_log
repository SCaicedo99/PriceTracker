Week of Jul 7:
- I just watched a video on youtube that inspired me to expand it, so I'll give it a try.
I took the code that was on the video and will be changing it to meet my needs and other
ideas that I might get.
- Decided that I will be creating classes for each website, for now there is only one class
which is AmazonItem which only needs the amazon URL to be instantiated.
- Just got the idea of using the website camelcamel.com to find about an item's price history
on amazon.com

Week of Jul 14:
- After implementing all of the attributes (so far) needed for AmazonItem, using a single url
I am thinking of trying it with different urls, and I have encountered some problems, some urls
have different syntax on how they display the price on amazon, so it created an issue when trying
to use the function for that.
Also, I have realized that some items were not sold being sold by amazon but by other sellers
this means that camelcamel.com does not have the data for highest/lowest price by amazon, which
also creates some problems with my current functions. Need to work on that

- Amazon.com has different ways of displaying its prices, and that sometimes breaks the code
this means that I have to look around and see how many different ways Amazon displays its prices
and make my code robust enough so it doesn't break, and it still shows usable information to the user
Some items have availability information ( X items left, order soon) so I need to also cover that

- Thought that I am also going to need to check for availability, so this will need a function for that

Week of Jul 21:
-I am starting to look for different libraries that will help to make the GUI, the two candidates
at the moment are WxPython and Tkinter. Decided to use Tkinter for this project.
- I have found this weird bug that whenever I try parsing through the amazon_urls.txt file, as I parse it, I create a
new instance of AmazonItem, but for some of the urls it is not retrieving the camelcamel historic information, but if I
do it without using a loop, there is no problem. FIXED IT,


Week of Aug 11:
- Picked up the project again, started working on the GUI, still trying to figure out how to display the information
since there is not a table implemented with tkinter, so I will have to come up with my own implementation




--- Create a user story (200 words), describe why people need your product, what benefits
can it bring to other people
--- Succesfull criteria, what functionality do you expect your product to have
list 5-7 functions my project can provide
--- Structure diagram / User flow diagram for the project. the steps that a user will
take to use the program
--- Documentation ( it can wait for now), while you're working on the project
remember 3 highlights.
