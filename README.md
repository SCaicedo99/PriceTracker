## Price Tracker

This is a personal project that I will be working on during the summer.

I will be using python to write code that will access websites,
check the prices of certain items that will be predetermined (for now),
and send an email if the price of those items fall below a certain 
predetermined amount by the user. 

## Future ideas:
- Compare prices over time, see if I can access the price of an item over time
 and give the user an idea of how the current price compares to the price in the
 past, that way the user can make a better decision.
 - In the future make a GUI to make it more user friendly, rather than just a
 text command based
